              <p>
                Fall 2021-Present, Collaborators: Justin Raizes (CMU) & Chen-Da Liu (CMU)
                Ongoing research into whether improvements to protocol parameters can be 
                achieved when doing SMPQC for functions with a solitary output. Because of the 
                No Cloning Theorem, quantum results paralel to the classical results of Halevi 
                et. al 2019 present a natural problem and seem likely to be achievable.

              <p>
                Spring 2021-Summer 2021, Collaborators: Justin Raizes (CMU) & Paul Gölz
                (CMU) Studied the Multiparty Coin Flipping literature hoping to find 
                tools for de- veloping secure procedures for large scale sortition. 
                For instance in selecting US congressional representatives. Based on a
                  deep understanding of the re- quirements for Cleve’s impossibility 
                  result I developed several approaches which will be published in an

                turned out to be good (Rahul Ilango solved it in 2020) the tools I

                Bittman (UCSC) Many implementations of Non-Volatile-RAM deteriorate or 
                consume large amounts of energy with every bit flip. This project focused 
                on developing data structures and data-structure codes that reduced 
                bitflips. I think this area still has some very rich possibilities.

                Juntas in weak Hash functions such as SHA-1. We were fairly successful

                patterns, but did not ultimately discover a mathematically satisfying 
                explanation for why these hash functions were breakable.

              My name is Matthew Gray and I am currently serving as an Adjunct 
              Faculty Member at Renton Technical College teaching Web Development 
              and React Native while also working on curriculum changes and organizing
              guest speakers. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019 I completed a Bachelors of Arts with Honors in Computer Science
              and a Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics from the University of California
              Santa Cruz. This was the closest thing available to a degree in Theoretical
              Computer Science. While at UCSC I worked on a variety of research projects
              (most of which can be seen above), taught and TA'd several classes, helped 
              run a briefly existing group called the Computer Science Maker Space, took
              as many classes on CS theory as I could, volunteered as medical staff at 
              rock concerts, hunted for mushrooms, and played a lot of board games.
            </p>
            <p>
              After graduation, my partner and I moved to Oslo Norway where I had gotten a
              job at Microsoft. For my partner to stay in Norway she needed to get a job. 
              Hoping to get one, in the winter of 2020 she attended a Le Wagon web development
              bootcamp. But Covid shut down the world just as she was graduating and gutted
              the job market. And so now we are in the US and I am working for RTC.
